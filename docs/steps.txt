Task 1:

First of all I created a pom file dependency file that has all of the dependency i need (web app, redis, health checker)
at my CounterServlet.java controller file a add a annotations to till set my application as spring boot application.

I started with my hello world web app then how to get the count of the victors for my web app then get the ip address.

Now I start to configuration the redis data base to get requites but i could not do that by my self honestly I asked i friend
to help my with rides implementation. :/

I save my app under /task1/APP and started with the extra:
   - the health check ready from the pom file dependency implementation.

note: you need to save ip and user-agent to the data base and implement right way.
