Steps should be here !

________________

Task 1:

First of all I created a pom file dependency file that has all of the dependency i need (web app, redis, health checker)
at my CounterServlet.java controller file a add a annotations to till set my application as spring boot application.

I started with my hello world web app then how to get the count of the victors for my web app then get the ip address.

Now I start to configuration the redis database to get requites but i could not do that by my self honestly I asked i friend
to help my with rides implementation. :/

I could not implement rides database the right way but you can test it by run it locally.

I save my app under /task1/APP and started with the extra:
   - the health check ready from the pom file dependency implementation.

note: you need to save ip and user-agent to the data base and implement right way.

Task 2:

So I started by create a builder.sh file that first think first check if the repo i needed is there of not.

Create a dockerfile and read more about multi-stage docker images build the first one build my app and the second one
run it.

Implement ability to run the image in debug mode and set network=host and the rest of args.

Test that my application image and container is working fine push it and save it.

extra points:
   - Build the exit status codes.
